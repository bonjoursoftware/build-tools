#### Developer's comment

üïµÔ∏è Can you spot differences when integrating Bonjour Software `build-tools` in a Poetry project and in a Pipenv
project? No? Good! That's by design! üòÅ

Bonjour Software `build-tools` integration in Poetry and Pipenv projects is seamless and doesn't need any specific
configuration.
